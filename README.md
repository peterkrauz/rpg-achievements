# Rpg Achievements 

This is a toy project that serves as a REST api for an Android App to talk to. Having lack of a better and quicker alternative, i decided to give [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) a try. Marvelous tools and documentation regarding [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html) and Phoenix made this project possible for an Android Developer to develop. This whole thing was made in about three hours, from scratch.

## How to run it

Clone the repo, enter the directory, type `mix deps.get` to fetch dependencies. After that, run `mix phx.server` to execute the application. The result can be found on `localhost:4000`.
